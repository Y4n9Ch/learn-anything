# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Standalone API server** (`serve.mjs`): Extracted the serve API logic from the Vite plugin into a standalone server, providing cleaner separation between the dev server and data layer.

### Changed

- **HTTP API data layer**: Refactored `useTopicData.ts` to fetch topic data via HTTP API instead of static file imports, enabling dynamic data updates without rebuild.
- **Simplified vite.config.ts**: Removed the inline serve API plugin; the API server now runs independently via `serve.mjs`.
- **`bundle-site.mjs` refactored**: Streamlined the site build bundle script.

### Removed

- **Legacy modules**: Removed `files.ts` and `site-generator.ts` — their functionality has been absorbed into the new API server and build pipeline.

### Fixed

- **CI build**: Added `packages/cli/site/` to the pnpm workspace so its dependencies (vue, vue-router) are installed by CI, resolving a build failure.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Visual learning site**: A custom Vue 3 + Vite application with Vue Router, Tailwind CSS v4, markdown-it, and highlight.js. Provides a rich visual interface to browse knowledge maps, session notes, and exercise files.
- **SiteGenerator class**: Writes front-end site files into `.learn/` directory, with smart config overwrite rules and `--force` mode.
- **`serve` command**: `learn-anything serve [path]` generates the visual site, installs dependencies, and starts a Vite dev server with hot module replacement.
- **`--site` flag**: `learn-anything init --site` and `learn-anything update --site` generate the visual site alongside skill/command files.
- **Interactive site prompt**: `init` and `update` now prompt whether to generate the visual learning site in interactive mode.
- **Enhanced file scanning**: `sessions/*.md` and `exercises/*` files without subdirectory grouping are now supported and displayed as a flat list at the bottom of the sidebar.
- **Hot module replacement**: Modifying topic files (state.json, sessions, exercises) triggers automatic browser refresh.
- **New main specs**: `site-build`, `site-cli`, `site-generator`, `site-theme` specifications added.

### Changed

- **Monorepo structure**: `packages/cli/site/` now houses the standalone Vue 3 front-end app. Site files are bundled into `packages/cli/src/site/files.ts` at build time.
- **`.learn/` layout**: Site files now live under `.learn/site/`, separate from `.learn/topics/`.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Source location annotations**: Code examples in the explain workflow now include source file and line number references, helping the AI tutor provide precise cross-references during Socratic explanations.
- **Star History chart**: Added an embeddable Star History chart to all README files for better visual visibility of project growth.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-11

### Changed

- **Monorepo architecture**: Converted the project to a pnpm monorepo with `packages/cli` (published as `learn-anything-cli`) and `packages/gui` (private, future GUI). Build, test, and lint commands now support per-package execution via `pnpm -F`.
- **Simplified build pipeline**: Replaced the custom `build.js` wrapper with direct `tsc` compilation, reducing indirection and making the build process more standard.

### Added

- **README enhancements**: Added badges, monorepo structure diagram, and footer to all READMEs for better visual polish and discoverability.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **YAML frontmatter compatibility for Codex**: Changed `Dual-mode:` to `Dual-mode (...)` in SKILL_DESCRIPTION to avoid colon being interpreted as a YAML key-value separator causing invalid frontmatter in Codex.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Directory-based explanation storage**: Explanation sessions now store files organized by directory structure, matching the topic hierarchy in `state.json` for better session management and navigation.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- **Learn Protocol v1**: `state.json` is now the single source of truth for all learning data, using a hierarchical knowledge map format (domains → concepts → details). The old dual-file model (state.yaml + hand-written knowledge-map.md) is replaced — `knowledge-map.md` is now a **generated artifact** produced by `render.mjs` from `state.json`, never edited directly. AI instructions explicitly forbid reading or writing `knowledge-map.md` as a data source.
- **Automatic v0→v1 migration**: Existing learning data is auto-migrated on `learn-anything init` or `update`, with backup files created for safety.
- **Schema validation**: `render.mjs` validates `state.json` against the v1 schema before generating `knowledge-map.md`, with clear error messages on field mismatches.
- **Status script**: New standalone `status.mjs` script reads `state.json` and outputs a formatted heatmap or topic summary, reducing AI token spend. Supports `--locale en|zh-CN` for i18n output.
- **Shared utils** (`utils.mjs`): Extracted shared types, validation, and helpers used by both `render.mjs` and `status.mjs`.

### Changed

- **Prompt compression**: Reduced skill template INSTRUCTIONS by ~69% (457 fewer lines) across 4 workflow templates, eliminating redundancy while preserving all functional behavior.
- **Unified learning icons**: Replaced mixed icon styles with a consistent colored circle set (🟢 🔵 🟠 ⚪) across `render.mjs`, migration code, skill templates, and test fixtures.
- **All 5 workflow templates** updated to read/write `state.json` only, dropping `knowledge-map.md` as a data source.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- Optional Context7 MCP integration for documentation verification during `init`. When enabled, generated skill files (topic, explain, practice) include guidance instructing the AI to verify explanations against official documentation using Context7 MCP tools (`resolve-library-id` + `query-docs`).
- `--context7` / `--no-context7` CLI flags for non-interactive Context7 control.
- After init, displays a setup hint with a link to Context7 docs for manual MCP configuration.
- i18n support for Context7 prompts in both `en` and `zh-CN`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- CI workflow (GitHub Actions): lint, test, and build on every push and PR.
- Pre-commit hooks: Husky with lint-staged for ESLint, Prettier, and commitlint.

### Fixed

- Session files now written BEFORE echoing to conversation in `learn:practice` and `learn:explain` workflows, eliminating drift between saved content and chat output.
- Test path assertions made cross-platform compatible (Windows vs Unix path separators).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Relax `engines.node` from `>=20.19.0` to `>=20.0.0` for broader compatibility.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Dual-mode practice: Project Mode creates real code files in your IDE; Chat Mode for conceptual discussion.
- Persist learning session records for continuity across sessions.

### Fixed

- Reword session-save timing from "after" to "in the same turn" for clarity.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- `learn-anything` CLI: generate skill and command files for 30+ AI coding tools.
- `init` command: interactive tool detection and selection, skill generation.
- `update` command: update existing skill files.
- Five learning workflows: topic, explain, practice, review, status.
- Locale support: English (`en`) and Chinese (`zh-CN`).
- MIT License.
