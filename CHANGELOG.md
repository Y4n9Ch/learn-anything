# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **Quiz card practice UI**: Interactive quiz modal with keyboard shortcuts, card slide transitions, and 4 question-type renderers (multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-blank, error correction).
- **Quiz results & summary views**: Per-question grading feedback with explanations, multi-group score breakdown with progress bars.
- **Multi-group queue mode**: Sequential and shuffled batch quiz across concept groups, with per-group retry and aggregate summary.
- **Sidebar quiz tree**: New sidebar tab listing quizzes grouped by concept, with one-click single-deck launch and batch sequential/random buttons.
- **Quiz test fixtures**: 6 quiz.json files across JavaScript, Python, and React topics covering all 4 question types.

### Changed

- **READMEs synced with quiz workflow**: Both the English and Chinese READMEs now document the single-flow `/learn:quiz <name>` command (replacing the stale `<generate|grade>` two-stage syntax) and include the new `quizzes/` directory in the project structure tree.
- **CSS design tokens**: Added `--color-mastered-rgb` and `--color-brand-2-rgb` for alpha transparency support in composable styles.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **Quiz workflow (`/learn:quiz`)**: A new single-flow text Q&A quiz that generates, grades, and persists a reusable question deck per concept. Supports four text-answer question types — multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-blank, error correction — with a `gradeable` model (`exact` / `accepted` / `ai_only`) for consistent AI grading. Decks are saved as structured `quiz.json` files, enabling future zero-token re-practice on the dashboard.
- **Quiz deck validation (`validate-quiz.mjs`)**: A standalone validation script (mirroring `render.mjs`) that checks each `quiz.json` deck against the v1 schema — field types, type↔gradeable consistency, and required sub-fields — immediately after the deck is written. Ships inside the `learn-anything-quiz` skill directory.
- **Shared state-update table**: Quiz and practice now share a single `STATE_UPDATE_TABLE` for learning-progress updates, keeping the two workflows in sync.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- **Search result layout**: Title and file path columns in search results now split the available width equally, preventing long paths from compressing the title to a single character. Long paths truncate from the left so the filename remains visible.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- **Auto-find free port for `serve`**: When running `learn-anything serve`, if the target port is already in use the server now automatically probes for the next available port (up to 50 attempts) instead of exiting with an error. Use `--strict-port` to opt out and require the exact port.
- **TOC activeId flash on click**: When clicking a heading in the table of contents sidebar, the active highlight no longer flickers through intermediate headings during smooth scroll. The IntersectionObserver is temporarily suppressed until the scroll animation completes.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Heading search (⌘K / Ctrl+K)**: A VitePress-style command palette opens via keyboard shortcut or sidebar button, letting users jump to any heading across session notes, the knowledge map, and exercise docs. The server builds a lazy, cached search index (`/api/search-index`) that refreshes on file change; the client filters locally with no per-keystroke requests.
- **Heading anchor links**: Every rendered heading now carries a deep-linkable `id` and a hover-revealed `#` permalink (brand-accent color). Clicking the anchor or entering a `#slug` URL scrolls smoothly to the section, surviving async content loads and page refreshes. CJK heading text is preserved in slugs.
- **Table of contents outline**: A right-side sticky TOC panel (visible at `xl` breakpoint and above) lists `h2`/`h3` headings for the current note or knowledge map. An `IntersectionObserver` scroll-spy highlights the active section; clicking an item scrolls to it and syncs the URL hash.

### Fixed

- **Dark-mode scrollbar colors**: Native scrollbars (sidebar tree, search modal, code blocks) now adapt to dark mode via CSS-variable-based `scrollbar-color` and `::-webkit-scrollbar` rules, instead of showing the light system default.
- **Heading anchor accessibility**: The permalink anchor switched from `aria-hidden="true"` to `aria-label` + `tabindex="-1"`, resolving a browser warning when the anchor receives focus on click.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- **Sanitized HTML rendering**: Markdown output is now sanitized via DOMPurify. Safe HTML renders normally — including the `<details>/<summary>` collapsible blocks used for answers, tables, and code highlighting — while dangerous constructs (`<script>`, `on*` event handlers, `javascript:` URIs, `<iframe>`, etc.) are stripped, closing the `v-html` injection surface.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Automated release workflow**: `scripts/release.sh` orchestrates the full release end-to-end — `develop` → release branch → CI-gated PR to `main` → tag → GitHub Release → sync back to `develop`. Release notes are sourced from the gitignored `release-notes.md`, so the CHANGELOG, PR body, and GitHub Release all stay in sync from a single source.

### Changed

- **Cleaner shareable URLs**: The sidebar tab (notes/exercises) is now inferred from the selected file's path (`/topics/<slug>/sessions/` vs `/topics/<slug>/exercises/`) instead of a redundant `&tab=` query parameter. Switching tabs is now a pure UI action that no longer pollutes the URL.

### Fixed

- **Python dunders render verbatim**: `__init__`, `__proto__`, `__name__`, and other dunder identifiers no longer get mangled into bold (`<strong>init</strong>`) by markdown's underscore emphasis rule. Underscore-based emphasis is now disabled, while `*`/`**` emphasis (bold/italic), code blocks, inline code, and links are fully preserved. (The knowledge map's manual `\_\_proto\_\_` escaping is no longer needed.)
- **Angle-bracket content no longer vanishes**: Sequences like `<init>`, `<T>`, and `<T extends U>` are no longer swallowed as raw HTML tags. Raw HTML in notes is disabled (`html: false`), which both fixes the disappearing-text bug and closes the `v-html` injection (XSS) surface.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Loading overlay**: Red-pen annotated loading overlay (150ms threshold) for file loads, matching the notebook design theme.
- **Sidebar tree expansion persistence**: Expanded domains/concepts now persist across navigation and page refresh via sessionStorage; expanding one node no longer collapses others.
- **Orphan directory marking**: Directories not in `state.json` (orphans) display their English name with a gray dot and a full-row hover tooltip.

### Changed

- **Sidebar trees mirror actual directories**: The notes and exercises trees now reflect the real `sessions/` and `exercises/` directory structure; `state.json` is used only for display names and ordering.
- **Empty directory display**: Empty directories (including orphans) are now shown in the sidebar with a "no notes/no exercises" placeholder.
- **Async content loading**: File selection is now synchronous while content loads asynchronously, eliminating first-render flicker.

### Fixed

- **Note flicker on reload**: Fixed the note content flicker on page reload.
- **Skeleton screen for empty content**: Fixed the skeleton loading screen incorrectly shown for files with empty content.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **File-to-URL sync**: Selecting a file in the sidebar now updates the browser URL (`?file=...&tab=...`), enabling shareable, bookmarkable links to specific notes and exercises.
- **Tab state persistence**: The sidebar tab selection (topics/exercises) persists across page reloads via the URL query parameter.

### Changed

- **Smart hot reload**: File changes no longer trigger a full page reload. Instead, a reactive `dataVersion` mechanism triggers component re-renders while preserving scroll position and UI state.
- **Tree auto-expand on reload**: The sidebar navigation tree now automatically expands to the node containing the currently selected file on page load, instead of always expanding the first domain.

### Fixed

- **Hot reload UX**: Eliminated disruptive full-page refreshes when editing notes or exercises. The page stays stable with scroll position preserved.
- **Sidebar state loss**: Fixed sidebar tab and tree expansion state being lost on page reload.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Standalone API server** (`serve.mjs`): Extracted the serve API logic from the Vite plugin into a standalone server, providing cleaner separation between the dev server and data layer.

### Changed

- **HTTP API data layer**: Refactored `useTopicData.ts` to fetch topic data via HTTP API instead of static file imports, enabling dynamic data updates without rebuild.
- **Simplified vite.config.ts**: Removed the inline serve API plugin; the API server now runs independently via `serve.mjs`.
- **`bundle-site.mjs` refactored**: Streamlined the site build bundle script.

### Removed

- **Legacy modules**: Removed `files.ts` and `site-generator.ts` — their functionality has been absorbed into the new API server and build pipeline.

### Fixed

- **CI build**: Added `packages/cli/site/` to the pnpm workspace so its dependencies (vue, vue-router) are installed by CI, resolving a build failure.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Visual learning site**: A custom Vue 3 + Vite application with Vue Router, Tailwind CSS v4, markdown-it, and highlight.js. Provides a rich visual interface to browse knowledge maps, session notes, and exercise files.
- **SiteGenerator class**: Writes front-end site files into `.learn/` directory, with smart config overwrite rules and `--force` mode.
- **`serve` command**: `learn-anything serve [path]` generates the visual site, installs dependencies, and starts a Vite dev server with hot module replacement.
- **`--site` flag**: `learn-anything init --site` and `learn-anything update --site` generate the visual site alongside skill/command files.
- **Interactive site prompt**: `init` and `update` now prompt whether to generate the visual learning site in interactive mode.
- **Enhanced file scanning**: `sessions/*.md` and `exercises/*` files without subdirectory grouping are now supported and displayed as a flat list at the bottom of the sidebar.
- **Hot module replacement**: Modifying topic files (state.json, sessions, exercises) triggers automatic browser refresh.
- **New main specs**: `site-build`, `site-cli`, `site-generator`, `site-theme` specifications added.

### Changed

- **Monorepo structure**: `packages/cli/site/` now houses the standalone Vue 3 front-end app. Site files are bundled into `packages/cli/src/site/files.ts` at build time.
- **`.learn/` layout**: Site files now live under `.learn/site/`, separate from `.learn/topics/`.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Source location annotations**: Code examples in the explain workflow now include source file and line number references, helping the AI tutor provide precise cross-references during Socratic explanations.
- **Star History chart**: Added an embeddable Star History chart to all README files for better visual visibility of project growth.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-11

### Changed

- **Monorepo architecture**: Converted the project to a pnpm monorepo with `packages/cli` (published as `learn-anything-cli`) and `packages/gui` (private, future GUI). Build, test, and lint commands now support per-package execution via `pnpm -F`.
- **Simplified build pipeline**: Replaced the custom `build.js` wrapper with direct `tsc` compilation, reducing indirection and making the build process more standard.

### Added

- **README enhancements**: Added badges, monorepo structure diagram, and footer to all READMEs for better visual polish and discoverability.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **YAML frontmatter compatibility for Codex**: Changed `Dual-mode:` to `Dual-mode (...)` in SKILL_DESCRIPTION to avoid colon being interpreted as a YAML key-value separator causing invalid frontmatter in Codex.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Directory-based explanation storage**: Explanation sessions now store files organized by directory structure, matching the topic hierarchy in `state.json` for better session management and navigation.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- **Learn Protocol v1**: `state.json` is now the single source of truth for all learning data, using a hierarchical knowledge map format (domains → concepts → details). The old dual-file model (state.yaml + hand-written knowledge-map.md) is replaced — `knowledge-map.md` is now a **generated artifact** produced by `render.mjs` from `state.json`, never edited directly. AI instructions explicitly forbid reading or writing `knowledge-map.md` as a data source.
- **Automatic v0→v1 migration**: Existing learning data is auto-migrated on `learn-anything init` or `update`, with backup files created for safety.
- **Schema validation**: `render.mjs` validates `state.json` against the v1 schema before generating `knowledge-map.md`, with clear error messages on field mismatches.
- **Status script**: New standalone `status.mjs` script reads `state.json` and outputs a formatted heatmap or topic summary, reducing AI token spend. Supports `--locale en|zh-CN` for i18n output.
- **Shared utils** (`utils.mjs`): Extracted shared types, validation, and helpers used by both `render.mjs` and `status.mjs`.

### Changed

- **Prompt compression**: Reduced skill template INSTRUCTIONS by ~69% (457 fewer lines) across 4 workflow templates, eliminating redundancy while preserving all functional behavior.
- **Unified learning icons**: Replaced mixed icon styles with a consistent colored circle set (🟢 🔵 🟠 ⚪) across `render.mjs`, migration code, skill templates, and test fixtures.
- **All 5 workflow templates** updated to read/write `state.json` only, dropping `knowledge-map.md` as a data source.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- Optional Context7 MCP integration for documentation verification during `init`. When enabled, generated skill files (topic, explain, practice) include guidance instructing the AI to verify explanations against official documentation using Context7 MCP tools (`resolve-library-id` + `query-docs`).
- `--context7` / `--no-context7` CLI flags for non-interactive Context7 control.
- After init, displays a setup hint with a link to Context7 docs for manual MCP configuration.
- i18n support for Context7 prompts in both `en` and `zh-CN`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- CI workflow (GitHub Actions): lint, test, and build on every push and PR.
- Pre-commit hooks: Husky with lint-staged for ESLint, Prettier, and commitlint.

### Fixed

- Session files now written BEFORE echoing to conversation in `learn:practice` and `learn:explain` workflows, eliminating drift between saved content and chat output.
- Test path assertions made cross-platform compatible (Windows vs Unix path separators).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Relax `engines.node` from `>=20.19.0` to `>=20.0.0` for broader compatibility.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Dual-mode practice: Project Mode creates real code files in your IDE; Chat Mode for conceptual discussion.
- Persist learning session records for continuity across sessions.

### Fixed

- Reword session-save timing from "after" to "in the same turn" for clarity.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- `learn-anything` CLI: generate skill and command files for 30+ AI coding tools.
- `init` command: interactive tool detection and selection, skill generation.
- `update` command: update existing skill files.
- Five learning workflows: topic, explain, practice, review, status.
- Locale support: English (`en`) and Chinese (`zh-CN`).
- MIT License.
